5. Vehicle maintenance: Failing to properly maintain a vehicle can lead to mechanical failures that can cause an accident.
6. Impaired driving: Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can significantly impair a driver's ability to operate a vehicle safely and increase the risk of being involved in an accident.

1. Genetics: Maybe Kaito's small eyes are just a result of his genetic makeup. Some people are born with smaller eyes due to their genes, and there's no particular reason for it.
2. Eye injury: Perhaps Kaito had an injury to his eyes when he was younger, which caused them to shrink in size. This could be a temporary or permanent condition, depending on the severity of the injury.

1. Genetics: Maybe Kaito's small eyes are just a result of his genetic makeup. Some people are born with smaller eyes due to their genes, and there's no particular reason for it.
2. Eye injury: Perhaps Kaito had an injury to his eyes when he was younger, which caused them to shrink in size. This could be a temporary or permanent condition, depending on the severity of the injury.
3. Medical condition: There are several medical conditions that can affect the size of a person's eyes, such as thyroid problems or Graves' disease. Maybe Kaito has one of these conditions, which is causing his eyes to be smaller than normal.

1. Genetics: Maybe Kaito's small eyes are just a result of his genetic makeup. Some people are born with smaller eyes due to their genes, and there's no particular reason for it.
2. Eye injury: Perhaps Kaito had an injury to his eyes when he was younger, which caused them to shrink in size. This could be a temporary or permanent condition, depending on the severity of the injury.
3. Medical condition: There are several medical conditions that can affect the size of a person's eyes, such as thyroid problems or Graves' disease. Maybe Kaito has one of these conditions, which is causing his eyes to be smaller than normal.
4. Environmental factors: Kaito might be exposure to something in his environment that is causing his eyes to shrink. For example, he might be exposed to a toxin or radiation that is affecting his eye size.
